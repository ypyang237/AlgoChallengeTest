###Test...Solve...Refactor...Commit

We are going to be doing a quickfire challenge to solve the following objectives in a short amount of time in the following order:

1. Create a new project
2. Setup mocha/chai to be our testing framework
3. Write a few tests for the algorithm we are going to solve
4. Implement our algorithm
5. Make the tests pass
6. Refactor our code and ensure that tests still pass
7. Create new repo on your GitHub profile and push up our solution

###The Challenge
Write an algorithm that with a given single input of type Number, returns the sum of the square root of every number from 1 to the number that was passed in.
